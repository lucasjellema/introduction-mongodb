A plucky woman who would not tolerate abuse, she divorced his father, Leslie Lynch King Sr., within the year, and less than three years later, was married to Gerald Rudolff Ford, a local paint company salesman, from whence Jerry Jr. got his name—although it was not made legal until he was 22 years old. A star college football player, he served in the Navy during WWII. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1948, Ford represented Michigan's 5th District for nearly 25 years before suddenly finding himself at the crossroads of history. He was elevated to vice president, and then became the 38th U.S. president due to Richard Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal and subsequent resignation. Ford was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election. He died in California in 2006.]'

In 2012, he won a silver medal in both the 100-meter and 200-meter races, losing to rival and fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt in both events. Famed sprinter Yohan Blake, nicknamed 'The Beast' by fans, was born on December 26, 1989 in St. James, Jamaica. Blake began running competitively in the 100 and 200 meters at a young age. In 2009, he tested positive for methylaxanthine at the Jamaican Championships, and was banned for three months. He has since won various honors, including two gold medals at the 2011 World Championships, in the 100 and the 4-by-100-meter relay. Blake holds the record in the 4-by-100-meter relay and the national junior record in the 100. His best time in the 100 is 9.75 seconds. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, he won a silver medal in the 100 meters with a time of 9.75 seconds, just shy of his rival Usain Bolt's 9.63 seconds.
